# Traffic Safety and Smartphone Usage Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between traffic safety trends and smartphone usage patterns in the United States. 

By examining collision data from 2006 to 2020 and smartphone usage data from 2011 to 2019, the project aims to identify potential correlations and insights into distracted driving behaviors.


## Data Sources

1. Traffic Safety Data: Monthly total numbers of collisions normalized to population size were obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website.
2. Smartphone Usage Data: Quarterly percentage of American adults reporting smartphone ownership and usage were sourced from the Pew Research Center's website.

## Project Structure
1. Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to visualize trends in crash rates over time and assess seasonal variations.
2. Relationship Analysis: Statistical analysis, including correlation calculation and linear regression modeling, was performed to examine the relationship between smartphone usage and crash rates.
3. Prediction: Predictive modeling was utilised to forecast crash rates based on smartphone usage trends.
